## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug:

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/openhotel/openhotel/issues) to see if itâ€™s already reported.
2. If not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/openhotel/openhotel/issues/new). Include:
    - A clear and descriptive title.
    - Steps to reproduce the bug.
    - Expected vs. actual behavior.
    - Your operating system, browser version, and any logs if applicable.

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! To propose a feature:

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/openhotel/openhotel/issues) to ensure it hasnâ€™t been suggested.
2. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/openhotel/openhotel/issues/new) and include:
    - A detailed description of the feature.
    - Why this feature would benefit users.
    - Any implementation ideas (optional).

### Code Contributions

We accept contributions of all sizes! Examples include:

- Improving existing functionality or adding new features.
- Resolving issues.
- Fixing typos or improving documentation.

### Art Contributions

Open Hotel uses a pixel art style for its assets, and it uses metadata to define some of the properties of the assets. We strongly recommend taking a look at our [Asset Editor](https://github.com/openhotel/asset-editor) repository to create compatible assets. Some examples of contributions include:

- Icons, sprites, furniture, character clothes...
- UI/UX improvements.
- Backgrounds, tiles, and other visual elements.

Make sure any artistic contributions align with the overall aesthetic and respect licensing terms.

### Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests! Hereâ€™s how to ensure a smooth process:

- Use the following convention for PR titles: `type: descriptive text - fix #XXX`. Here:
    - `type` should be descriptive (e.g., `feat` for features, `fix` for bug fixes, `art` for art-focused PRs).
    - `XXX` refers to the related issue (if there is one).
    - Examples:
        - `feat: Add user profile customization - fix #12` (On merge, issue 12 will be closed automatically)
        - `fix: Bug where character doesnâ€™t move - fix #42` (On merge, issue 42 will be closed automatically)
- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest `master` branch before opening a pull request.
- Provide a clear description of your changes in the pull request body.
- Add tests if applicable.
- Run tests if available and ensure all checks pass before submitting.
- Check the coding guidelines below for code formatting and style. Your PR will be automatically checked for formatting issues.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Enable Prettier:** Use `npx prettier --write .` to format your code. On Windows, Prettier sometimes bugs out and says that all files have been modified. Ignore it, and add/commit/push normally.
- **Write Tests:** If you can, add tests for any new functionality. Some features may be hard to test; if so, mention it in your PR. Run tests if they are available.
- **Follow Commit Guidelines:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Respect the Project Scope:** Ensure contributions align with Open Hotelâ€™s mission to remain open and non-commercial.

### Development Tips

- Regularly sync with the `master` branch to avoid conflicts.
- Run existing tests (if thereâ€™s any test) before pushing changes.

## Objective of the project:

- Create a virtual Open Hotel social-network/game.
- Gain virtual credits from mini-games inside the game, never pay for anything.
- Be able to create your own Hotel and add your own customization with plugins, configurations, rules...
- Protect the consumer from abusive and speculative companies.

## How to run the project

You can run OpenHotel either with native installations (Deno + Node) or via Docker.

If it's the first time running the project:

- Go to `./app/server/config.yml` and change the `version` to `development`. Restart the process.
- On the browser, add a localStorage item with key `username` and value of your choice.
- Reload the browser
- Go to `./app/server/users.yml` and add the username on the `op` list
- Go to `Room 1` and use the command `/set flags@pirate 3 3 0 0 20` 🏴‍☠️

### Option A: Run Locally (Deno + Node)

If you prefer running without Docker:

#### Install Dependencies

- Deno >= 1.44
- Node >= 20
- Yarn (make sure Corepack is enabled if using Yarn 4)

#### Start project

- Run `deno task install` to install dependencies.
- Run `deno task start` to start the server.
- Set `version` to `development` in the `app/server/config.yml` file.

### Option B: Run with Docker (Development)

#### Install docker

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

#### Build and start

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will spin up both the server (Deno) and the client (Vite/React) in development mode, with hot reload.

> [!NOTE]
>
> There’s no need to install Deno or Node on your host machine, as Docker handles them.
> By default, the server runs on port 20240, and the client on port 2024. Check or adjust your docker-compose.yml if needed.
> In development mode, changes to your code are automatically reflected without rebuilding the image.
